    "# Spot-Check Classification Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Spot-checking is a way of discovering which algorithms perform well on your machine learning problem. You cannot know which algorithms are best suited to your problem beforehand. You must trial a number of methods and focus attention on those that prove themselves the most promising. In this chapter you will discover six machine learning algorithms that you can use when spot-checking your **classification problem** in Python with scikit-learn. After completing this lesson you will know:\n",
    "1. How to spot-check machine learning algorithms on a classification problem.\n",
    "2. How to spot-check two linear classification algorithms.\n",
    "3. How to spot-check four nonlinear classification algorithms.\n",

    "You cannot know which algorithm will work best on your dataset beforehand. <a>You must use trial and error to discover a shortlist of algorithms that do well on your problem that you can then double down on and tune further</a>. I call this **>process spot-checking**>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is not: **What algorithm should I `use` on my dataset**? Instead it is: **What algorithms should I `spot-check` on my dataset**? You can guess at what algorithms might do well on your dataset, and this can be a good starting point. I recommend trying a mixture of algorithms and see what is good at picking out the structure in your data. Below are some suggestions when spot-checking algorithms on your dataset:\n",
    "***\n",
    "- Try a mixture of `algorithm representations` (e.g. instances and trees).\n",
    "- Try a mixture of `learning algorithms` (e.g. different algorithms for learning the same type of representation).\n",
    "- Try a mixture of `modeling types` (e.g. linear and nonlinear functions or parametric and nonparametric).\n",
    "***\n",
    "Let's get specific. In the next section, we will look at algorithms that you can use to spot-check on your next classification machine learning project in Python.\n",

    "We are going to take a look at six **classification algorithms** that you can spot-check on your dataset. Starting with two `linear machine learning` algorithms:\n",

    "- Support Vector Machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each recipe is demonstrated on the dataset. A test harness using 10-fold cross validation is used to demonstrate how to spot-check each machine learning algorithm and mean accuracy measures are used to indicate algorithm performance. The recipes assume that you know about each machine learning algorithm and how to use them. We will not go into the API or parameterization of each algorithm.\n",
