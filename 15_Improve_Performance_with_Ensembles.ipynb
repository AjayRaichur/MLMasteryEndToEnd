    "\n",
    "Ensembles can give you a boost in accuracy on your dataset. In this chapter you will discover how you can create some of the most powerful types of ensembles in Python using scikit-learn. This lesson will step you through Boosting, Bagging and Majority Voting and <a>show you how you can continue to ratchet up the accuracy of the models on your own datasets</a>. After completing this lesson you will know:\n",
    "1. How to use `bagging ensemble` methods such as **bagged decision trees**, **random forest** and **extra trees**.\n",
    "2. How to use `boosting ensemble` methods such as **AdaBoost** and **stochastic gradient boosting**.\n",

    "## 15.1 Combine Models Into Ensemble Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "The three most popular methods for combining the predictions from different models are:\n",
    "- **Bagging**. Building multiple models (typically of the same type) <a>from different subsamples of the training dataset</a>.\n",
    "- **Boosting**. Building multiple models (typically of the same type) <a>each of which learns to fix the prediction errors of a prior model in the sequence of models</a>.\n",
    "- **Voting**. Building multiple models (typically of differing types) and <a>simple statistics (like calculating the mean) are used to combine predictions</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumes you are generally familiar with machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods and will not go into the details of how the algorithms work or their parameters. The dataset is used to demonstrate each algorithm. Each ensemble algorithm is demonstrated using 10-fold cross validation and the classification accuracy performance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15.2 Bagging Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "`Bootstrap Aggregation` (or **Bagging**) involves <a>taking multiple samples from your training dataset with replacement) and training a model for each sample. The final output prediction is averaged across the predictions of all of the sub-models</a>. The three bagging models covered in this section are as follows:\n",

    "### 15.2.1 Bagged Decision Trees\n",

    "Bagging performs best with <a>algorithms that have high variance. A popular example are decision trees, often constructed without pruning (poda)<a>. In the example below is an example of using the BaggingClassifier with the Classification and Regression Trees algorithm (DecisionTreeClassifier). A total of 100 trees are created."

Samples of the <a>training dataset are taken with replacement, but the trees are constructed in a way that reduces the correlation between individual classifiers. Specifically, rather than greedily choosing the best split point in the construction of each tree, only a random subset of features are considered for each split</a>. You can construct a Random Forest model for classification using the RandomForestClassifier class. The example below demonstrates using Random Forest for classification with 100 trees and split points chosen from a random selection of 3 features."
