    "Finding an accurate machine learning model is not the end of the project. In this chapter you  will discover how to save and load your machine learning model in Python using scikit-learn. This allows you to save your model to file and load it later in order to make predictions. After completing this lesson you will know:\n",

    "`Pickle` is the <a>standard way of serializing objects in Python. You can use the pickle operation to serialize your machine learning algorithms and save the serialized format to a file. Later you can load this file to deserialize your model and use it to make new predictions</a>. The example below demonstrates how you can train a logistic regression model on the dataset, save the model to fie and load it to make predictions on the unseen test set."

It provides utilities for saving and loading Python objects that make use of NumPy data structures, efficiently. This can be useful for some machine learning algorithms that require a lot of parameters or store the entire dataset (e.g. k-Nearest Neighbors)</a>.

Often the techniques used internally by machine learning algorithms to make predictions are a lot simpler than those used to learn the parameters can may be easy to implement in custom code that you have control over.\n",
